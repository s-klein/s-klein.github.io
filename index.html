  <h3 class="header-style">Experience</h3>
  <p>
	  I am a cybersecurity engineer with over ten years of 
          experience safeguarding enterprise infrastructure and shaping 
          resilient systems at scale, including work for large international
          corporations, start-ups, retail IT systems, and universities. 
          My career spans embedded Linux platforms, open-source development, 
          and academic collaborations on privacy and application security. 
          I'm currently on sabbatical for full-time parenting while continuing 
          to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
